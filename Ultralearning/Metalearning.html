            <ul>
              <li>Meta - beyond or about itself. Learning about Learning</li>
              <li>For languages: "monolingual fieldwork" is a technique for learning indigenous languages. It's purely metalearning as it's a technique to learn</li>
              <li>Metalinguistic awareness: knowing 2 languages helps learning a 3rd.</li>
              <li>In language, metalearning is very clear. But exists in every field</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How to draw your map</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Determining Why, What and How</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Figure out your motivation to learn, the knowledge and abilities you need to acquire to be successful and the resources, environment and methods you will use.</li>
                <li><h5>Why</h5></li>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Expert interview method</b>: To figure out the why, make sure this why is true (job prospects? Will learning X help you get to where you want to be?). Talk to "experts" to confirm or redirect you.</li>
                  <li>For intrinsically motivated projects it's also useful - it will help you find the best plan of action, examining exactly why you want to do it you can eliminate all that doesn't get you there directly and be more efficient.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h5>What</h5></li>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Concepts, Facts and Procedures</b></li>
                  <li><b>Concepts</b>: What needs to be understood in a flexible and deep way</li>
                  <li><b>Facts</b>: What you need to remember. No need to understand them too deeply. Languages are full of facts.</li>
                  <li><b>Procedures</b>: What needs to be <i>practiced</i>. Procedural skills.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <li>Using this analysis to draw your map</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If there's a lot of memorization, invest in a system such as spaced-repetition software. If concepts, consider spending time explaining those to people.</li>
                <li>Knowing the bottlenecks and finding ways to solve them will make your study time more efficient and effective.</li>
                <li><h5>How</h5></li>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Benchmarking:</b> What are the common ways people learn this? - Default strategy and starting point. University syllabi. For non academic, search for people who have already done it and Expert Interview Method</li>
                  <li><b>Emphasize/Exclude method</b>: Now make modifications to your default curriculum.</li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Identify areas of study aligned with the goals. Focus on those</li>
                    <li>Exclude what doesn't align with the goal. If you want to speak Mandarin Chinese, focus on speaking as learning the characters can significantly delay your progress.</li>
                  </ol>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <li>How much planning should you do?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>People tend to not research enough on Goals, Methods and Resources, BUT</li>
                <li>Researching can be used as procrastination, specially if the method is uncomfortable</li>
              </ul>
              <li>The 10% Rule: Spend 10% of the total time you might be learning into research prior to starting.</li>
              <li>The more time you spend learning, the less the proportion might be. For a 1000h of learning, you might not want to spend 100h researching, but a bit less.</li>
              <li>Diminishing returns and marginal benefit claculation: Research and reassessment will be also necessary during the project, because new obstacles and opportunities will arise. Compare the <i>marginal benefits of metalearning to regular learning.</i> The only way to do it is to spend a few hours researching new techniques, try them out and compare the relative value fo the two activities. If metalearning still felt like contributing a lot, probably you will find it beneficial to do more. If the extra research wasn't too helpful, stick to the plan you had before.</li>
              <li><h3>Long term prospects of Metalearning</h3></li>
              <ul>
                <li>Each project will improve your metalearning, new ways of gathering resources, improved skills for managing motivation</li>
