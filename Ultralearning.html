            <h2>Notes on Ultralearning</h2>
            <h3>Podcast Financial Independence Europe</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Pick the projects that you are very motivated: the "yeah, that would be awesome if I knew X"</li>
              <li>For professional purposes: "what is the thing that would really help me for my career if I knew this."</li>
              <li>Do the same principles apply to Sports or physical activities? Yes, for sure. But with a caveat: There is a risk of injury that doesn't exist in other projects. If you ONLY speak chinese in China, you will have a rough time because you won't be able to communicate much at the beginning. If you throw yourself down the black ski track as a direct approach, you are in serious risk of breaking something. Motor skills and muscular memory might be techically a different cognitive system, but the principles still apply.</li>
              <li>How do I find the time?</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Part time. You need to be really efficient with the use of limited time</li>
                <li>Learning Sabbaticals: Summer off or a break in your career</li>
                <li>Retool the time you already spend learning</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Can you work on several ultralearning projects at the same time? There's some research on the interlinking of the different projects. Since there's a boot-up period where you enter the state of mind necessary for the thing you are ultralearning, switching contexts might make you better at booting up and recalling all the information you need. Science is not very definite or clear on that.</li>
              <li>HOWEVER: it's very easy to pick too many projects and then it becomes hard to stay motivated to do the HARD THINGS that will really push you forward in each of them.</li>
              <li>Hit key milestones before switching to learning another thing. That's a good way to not take on too many projects for people who tend to diffuse their attention on to too many things (this is more about motivation than cognitive ability).</li>
              <li>A lot of the ultralearning projects seem like very solitary. But that doesn't have to be like this. Example: language - it's inherently social! Or when searching for feedback, you need to interact with people a lot earlier in the process. Also, if you have someone to be your learning partner, you might push each other more than self-motivating and you become more accountable.</li>
              <li>It's an alternative to formal education. Sometimes you don't really want to spend 4 years doing something and spending so much money on it. When you are 18 you are committing yourself with very little experience. Ultralearning offers an alternative to that! Try an ultralearning project and "career-test".</li>
              <li>Metalearning: talk to people that have already learned that skill. Or talk to people with the career that you want.</li>

              <li>1 actionable tip for someone starting on their path to ultralearning: Whenever you start learning about something, think about HOW YOU ARE GOING TO USE IT. This way you can connect with your own doing and life from the beginning: it becomes part of your life.</li>
